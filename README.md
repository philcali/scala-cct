# Scala Course Converter Tool

This conversion tool is a complete ground up rewrite from LSU's Java [cct] (cover your eyes!). The software
desperately needed a face-lift, so I gave it one. The conversion process is entirely handled through
Scala (the xml parsing and what not). I found Scala to be a perfect fit for this type of problem


The tool is now complete with a test suite and an extension API (which I will go into later).

# How it works now

One app, two functions. You can now convert courses on the command-line, convert entire directories
of courses, or launch a web site and takes in an archive and spits out a converted course.


I recommend looking at the [options] for the converter to see how it works.
